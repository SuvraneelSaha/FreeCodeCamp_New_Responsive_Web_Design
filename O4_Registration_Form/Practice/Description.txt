CSS Margins
The CSS margin properties are used to create space around elements, outside of any defined borders.

Question : 
what happens when we set margin attribute in body rule to be 100% or 0 

block and inline elements are different 
in case of block elements they take up the whole area or size of that plane or webpage 
by default the browser gives bottom and top margins 

and in case of inline elements -- they take only the necessary size of the plane or webpage 
no margin by default 

Step 19 : 
label element --> signifies the text for anything special 
ex - input button or any input space area 

for attribute in label element --> signifies the context of the value 

input element--> takes in the input as a form of many different things 
like text email password blah blah 

type attribute in input element --> specifies the type of content inside the input box

id attribute in input element --> signifies the id by which it will be identified

With type="password" you can use the pattern attribute to define a regular expression that the password must match to be considered valid.

Add a pattern attribute to the password input element to require the input match: [a-z0-5]{8,}

The above is a regular expression which matches eight or more lowercase letters or the digits 0 to 5. Then, remove the minlength attribute, and try it out.

You only want one radio input to be selectable at a time. However, the form does not know the radio inputs are related.

Users will be able to register with a bio. Add a label with the text Provide a bio: at the end of the fieldset. Add a textarea element inside the label element. Note that the textarea requires a closing tag.

input element contains id attribute --< used for identification 
label element contains for attribute --> used as finding out for which purpose it is used 


 The placeholder accepts a text value, which is displayed until the user starts typing.
